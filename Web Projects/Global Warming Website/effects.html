                    <h1>Effects of Global Warming</h1>
                    <p>Each year scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and each year we also gain new evidence of its devastating impact on people and the planet. As the heat waves, droughts, and floods associated with climate change become more frequent and more intense, communities suffer and death tolls rise. If we're unable to reduce our emissions, scientists believe that climate change could lead to the deaths of more than 250,000 people around the globe every year and force 100 million people into poverty by 2030.</p>
                    <p>Global warming is already taking a toll on the world. And if we aren't able to get a handle on our emissions, here's just a smattering of what we can look forward to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Rise in Temperature</h3>
                            <p>Global warming has led to an incredible increase in earth's temperature. Since 1880, the earth's temperature has increased by ~1 degrees. This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level. This could have devastating effects on coastal regions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Threats to the Ecosystem</h3>
                            <p>Global warming has affected the coral reefs that can lead to the loss of plant and animal lives. Increase in global temperatures has made the fragility of coral reefs even worse.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
                            <p>Global warming has led to a change in climatic conditions. There are droughts at some places and floods at some. This climatic imbalance is the result of global warming.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Spread of Diseases</h3>
                            <p>Global warming leads to a change in the patterns of heat and humidity. This has led to the movement of mosquitoes that carry and spread diseases.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>High Mortality Rates</h3>
                            <p>Due to an increase in floods, tsunamis and other natural calamities, the average death toll usually increases. Also, such events can bring about the spread of diseases that can hamper human life.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Loss of Natural Habitat</h3>
                            <p>A global shift in the climate leads to the loss of habitats of several plants and animals. In this case, the animals need to migrate from their natural habitat and many of them even become extinct. This is yet another major impact of global warming on biodiversity.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
